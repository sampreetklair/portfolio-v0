    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Sampreet Klair and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. I am always willing to learn
        more and am trying my best to cope up with new technologies.<br>
        I started my journey back in 2017, when I decided to represent the Computer Science Department in my annual
        school exibition, and I started to learn about HTML and CSS. Even though I created a very basic webpage but
        subsequently my interset in development and programming got even stronger. And now the hobby that I used to
        practise in my leisure time is much more than just a hobby.<br>
        I am an aspiring software developer and currently looking for new opportunities.<br>
        Here are a few tools/technologies I can work with:<br>
        - HTML<br>
        - CSS<br>
        - JavaScript<br>
        - Python<br>
        - C++<br>
        - React<br>
        - NodeJS<br>
        - MongoDB</p>
